hhvm-config
===========

this contains the hhvm config and the composer.json we are currently playing around with.


hhvm tested with:

wordpress 3.8.1 multisite - everything basically works, some rewrites missing

newest version of fpdf - successfully renders pdf populated out of a folder of files.

PROBLEMS:
/wp-admin/, /wp-admin/network/ -> rewrite wont work, need to manually append index.php.


composer.json is wip.
